    <p>Basically big, fluffy, oversized hamsters. They're just friendly, goofy and laid-back. Simple as that. Honestly,

    <h2 class="blue">Platypuses</h2>
    <img src="img/platypus.jpg" alt="Platypus" width="600" />
    <p>In 1798, when the platypus was first discovered, british scientists didn't believe they were real. After all, they look like a cross between an otter, beaver, and duck. Even to this day, they're an enigma. Scientists have found that platypuses emit a biofluorescent green glow when they're put under UV light. But they have no idea why! In addition to all these awesome characteristics, they're adorable! Have I managed to convince you that these are the coolest creatures ever yet? If not,

    <h2 class="green">Frogs</h2>

    <p>FROGS! There are so many of them, and they're all incredible, so honestly I don't know where to begin. I mean, I could go ahead and type out every cool thing about the 6000+ types of frogs out there, but I want to finish up this assignment and move onto javascript, so here are some of my personal favourites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bullfrogs: They grow up to 6-8 inches, yet they can jump to a height of 10 times that! And they look goofy.</li>
      <li>Glass frogs: Just as the name points out, glass frogs are known for their transparent skin! All of its internal organs are visible, and these guys are some of the best camouflagers in the world! The way they camouflage themselves is really strange and mindblowing too! They're able to take all their red blood cells and store them in their reflective liver. Reality is stranger than fiction.</li>
      <li>Golden poison dart frogs: They may seem adorable at first glance, but just a gram of this frog's toxins are capable of killing 100 000 human beings.</li>
      <li>Wood frogs: In the winter, this frog can completely stop its breathing, heartbeat and muscle movements. They can freeze the water in their cells and replace it with glucose and urea. When winter comes to an end, its body just returns to normal!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The point is, frogs are really, really overpowered. And since I didn't have the time to list every awesome frog in existence, here's a
